#  Snakey 2D #
## Trevor Green, Amanda Smith, Connor Tribbett ##

### Project Summary: ###
Our team consists of Trevor Green, Amanda Smith, and Connor Tribbett. For our semester project, we developed a snake game called “Snakey 2D” in Java with JavaFX. The game runs locally through java to simplify development/deployment. A user is able to start the game, login with a username, and choose to play different modes of snake from the main menu. One of the modes is called normal snake where a player moves a snake around a map trying to collect food. Collecting food lengthens the player’s snake and increases its speed, but if the player runs into itself or a wall, the game is lost. There is also a ‘challenge’ mode of snake where the snake starts out moving much faster than normal to make the game harder. Finally, there is a multiplayer mode where two players can each control their own snake in one grid. In this mode, if a player runs into another player, they lose as well, allowing them to compete against each other. In all of these modes we are also planning on adding extra elements to make the game more fun like power ups that increase/decrease speed or reverse the direction the snake moves. Data will be stored based on users’ high scores to create a leaderboard and to be able to save the state of the game so it can be restarted at a later time. This will primarily be done through file writing. The menu, game, graphics, and data logic will all be implemented with OOP patterns. This will allow us to easily create different modes of the main snake game through code reuse. Overall, we will be making a desktop snake application in Java with JavaFX that will be able to store leaderboards and have different modes of snake with all kinds of fun additions.
